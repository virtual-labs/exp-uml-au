        "question": "2.Suppose you are working on a software project for a car rental company. You need to create a UML class diagram to represent the classes and relationships in the system. The system should be able to handle the rental of different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, and vans.

Based on this scenario, which of the following class diagram elements should be included?",

          "a": "a.A class for each type of vehicle, with attributes for make, model, year, and license plate number.",
          "b": "b.A class for each type of vehicle, with attributes for make, model, year, license plate number, and rental period.",
          "c": "c.A class for customers, with attributes for name, address, and rental history.",
